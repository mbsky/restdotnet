This library consists of a class implementing IHttpHandler that takes care of much of the heavy lifting associated with writing a HTTP web service.

Implementation consists of simply extending a class, adding methods, and decorating them with the appropriate Attributes.  REST.NET takes care of the caching, e-tags, etc.
